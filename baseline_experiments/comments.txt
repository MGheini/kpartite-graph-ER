                and only 232 have manufacturer
    in amazon: 1248 have desc, 1363 have price and name and man_name

--- for publications we always have all the fields so this
    will not be a problem

--- for products a metric combination of:
    - price+desc+name
        + price distance smaller than $10
        + for desc cosine similarity is used
        + for name trigrams is used
    - price+name
        + price distance smaller than $10
        + for name trigrams is used

--- for publications a metric combination of:
    - title+authors(unordered)
           + for title trigrams is used
           + for authors soft jaccard is used
    - title+auth1+other_authors(unordered)
           + for title trigrams is used
           + for first author jaro is used
           + for other authors soft jaccard is used
