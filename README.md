# kpartite-graph-ER
This repository includes a matlab implementation of an unsupervised entity resolution tool based on multi-type graph co-clustering. For details of this method refer to our paper: [Unsupervised Entity Resolution on Multi-type Graphs](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/papers/zhu16-iswc.pdf) published in ISWC 2016. This code is implemented by Linhong Zhu, first author of the paper.
